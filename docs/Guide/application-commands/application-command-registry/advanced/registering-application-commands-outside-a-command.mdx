title: Registering Application Commands outside a Command
---

You are able to register you application commands inside of their command class, but also outside of the class! Whether
it's a dynamic command or premium command, Sapphire can help you manage your application commands with ease.

:::warning

You shouldn't use all three methods at the same time, just one is enough! This is just an example of all three variants.

:::

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from '@discordjs/builders';
import { ApplicationCommandRegistries } from '@sapphire/framework';

// Acquires the registry keyed by 'uwu'
const registry = ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire('uwu');

// Registering with the discord.js options object
registry.registerChatInputCommand({
  name: 'uwu',
  description: 'Sends a uwu in chat'
});

// Registering with the builder
const builder = new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('uwu').setDescription('Sends a uwu in chat');
registry.registerChatInputCommand(builder);

// Registering with the builder provided by the method
registry.registerChatInputCommand((builder) => builder.setName('uwu').setDescription('Sends a uwu in chat'));
```
