## A general tip concerning code duplication

You will notice that with these new features, you may encounter a lot of code duplication, especially if you plan on
supporting all 3 types of commands. While we cannot control _how_ you code your bot, we have a recommendation for you:
abstract the argument parsing from the final function.

What does this mean? As an example let's take a look at a `ban` command: it needs to process the member to ban as well
an optional reason, action the member, and reply to the invoker of the command. In your `*Run` methods, you should parse
the member and reason, then pass those down to a method you build that handles the actual banning and replying to the
invoker.

However you end up handling situations like this will be up to you, but this our tip for you. 😄

## Commands

### ⚠️ Warnings

Per the deprecation in v2, the `run` method from commands is officially removed entirely and **will not be aliased nor
emit a warning when it's present instead of [`messageRun`][command-message-run].**

:::caution

Again, we reiterate. If you want to keep using message based commands and have NOT moved your `run` method to
[`messageRun`][command-message-run], you **MUST** do it. You **will not** get any more runtime warnings, nor TypeScript
errors. You have been warned.

:::

---

Secondly, the [`messageRun`][command-message-run] method is **no longer `abstract`**. This mostly affects TypeScript
users, but to clarify, due to the nature of our implementation, you are no longer forced to implement any of the `*Run`
methods in your code

:::caution

With that said, you ought to override at least one of the methods if you expect the command to work. That could be
either the [`messageRun`][command-message-run] method, the [`chatInputRun`][command-chat-input-run] method or the
[`contextMenuRun`][command-context-menu-run] method.

:::

### New stuff

#### Type guards

For TypeScript users (as well as JavaScript users that have TS checking enabled), the Command class now has 4 type
guards:

- [`supportsMessageCommands`][supportsmessagecommands]
- [`supportsChatInputCommands`][supportschatinputcommands]
- [`supportsContextMenuCommands`][supportscontextmenucommands]
- [`supportsAutocompleteInteractions`][supportsautocompleteinteractions]

These return `true` if the Command class you're invoking them on supports the respective `*Run` methods

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
const command = stores.get('commands').get('example')!;

if (command.supportsMessageCommands()) {
  console.log(`We can run message commands in the example command!`);
  // We know that this method is defined and present
  await command.messageRun(message);
}
```

#### Application Command Registry and what is it?

There is a new property on the Command class ([`applicationCommandRegistry`][command-acr]]) and a new method
([`registerApplicationCommands`][command-rac]). While [Application Command Registry][acr] goes more in-depth about what
the registry is and how it works, here's a basic run down of what they represent:

##### [`Command#applicationCommandRegistry`][command-acr]

This is a shortcut for the command's application command registry. There can only ever be 1 registry for 1 command name.
Realistically, it's kind of useless for most use-cases, but it's there for those that want it.

##### [`Command#registerApplicationCommands`][command-rac]

This method is called when a command gets loaded into the store, and is responsible for adding the builders or command
data for application commands. In the event the data you provided for registering the application command is invalid, a
CommandApplicationCommandRegistryError (`commandApplicationCommandRegistryError`) event is emitted with the error and
the command that had the error.

:::caution

If you've already registered the chat input command manually, or Sapphire registered it for you, copy the id from your
console and paste it in the [`idHints`][idhints] property of the `chatInputCommand` object. That will make Sapphire
recognize the command in the future, and update metadata (like the name, description, default permission or future
fields) instead of creating a new command. You can read more about what the [`idHints`][idhints] property actually on
the page about registering chat input commands [Registering Chat Input Commands -> idHints][rcic-idhints]

:::

Here's a simple example of how you can easily register a chat input command and handle its interactions right away!

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class SlashCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Says hello.'
    });
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerChatInputCommand((builder) =>
      builder //
        .setName(this.name)
        .setDescription(this.description)
    );
  }

  public override chatInputRun(interaction: Command.ChatInputInteraction) {
    return interaction.reply({
      content: `Hello World!`
    });
  }
}
```

## Preconditions

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

The `run` method has been removed from Preconditions. In it's place, just like for [Commands][commands], there are 3 new
optional methods you can create: [`messageRun`][precondition-message-run], [`chatInputRun`][precondition-chat-input-run]
and [`contextMenuRun`][precondition-context-menu-run].

:::warning

Just like in [Commands][commands], you ought to specify at least one of the methods if you expect the preconditions to
work. That could be either the `messageRun` method, the `chatInputRun` method or the `contextMenuRun` method.

:::

:::caution

For TypeScript users, the Precondition class is **no longer** `abstract`. This is due to the fact we cannot mark the
methods as conditionally abstract sadly, so it's up to you to implement the handlers required.

:::

### !!! DO NOT FORGET ABOUT THE OPTIONAL PRECONDITION METHODS !!!

You don't have to worry if you forget to implement a method for your preconditions that is expected to be there for your
commands. We air on the side of caution, so **if we expect a method to be present, but it is missing, we will
immediately prevent the command from being ran and you will see the error in the following events:**

- For chat input commands, you will receive a `chatInputCommandDenied` event
- For context menu commands, you will receive a `contextMenuCommandDenied` event
- For message commands, you will receive a `messageCommandDenied` event

This decision was taken to prevent accidental escalations from happening in your commands (think of a `ban` command that
can suddenly be ran by anyone and everyone. We love chaos but this is too much even for us! 😄)

:::info

All Sapphire pre-included preconditions, which you can see
[here](https://github.com/sapphiredev/framework/tree/main/src/preconditions), will come with handlers for all 3 possible
types of preconditions by default.

:::

### Internal changes to [`IPreconditionCondition`][ipreconditioncondition]

For that one person that's not us, the developers, that is working with PreconditionConditions, be aware that the
`sequential` and `parallel` methods have been removed, and you now have to implement a
[`messageSequential`][message-sequential] / [`messageParallel`][message-parallel] pair, a
[`chatInputSequential`][chat-input-sequential] / [`chatInputParallel`][chat-input-parallel] pair and a
[`contextMenuSequential`][context-menu-sequential] / [`contextMenuParallel`][context-menu-parallel] pair.

:::caution

**All 3 pairs are mandatory.**

:::

---

### Internal changes to [`IPreconditionContainer`], [`PreconditionContainerArray`] and [`PreconditionContainerSingle`]

The `run` method was removed from here too, and replaced with the methods of [`messageRun`][precondition-message-run],
[`chatInputRun`][precondition-chat-input-run] and [`contextMenuRun`][precondition-context-menu-run] (seeing a pattern
already?). These methods should also throw an error if a precondition is lacking the appropriate `*Run` method (in
Sapphire's implementation of these, it does throw an Error)

### New things

#### All flows Preconditions

If your bot has a lot of preconditions, and you support all methods of running a command, or you just want to have them
all implemented no matter what, we export an alias to the Precondition class called
[`AllFlowsPrecondition`][allflowsprecondition]. While this doesn't do much for JavaScript users, for TypeScript users
this will force you to implement the aforementioned run methods. Think of it as a simple alias for something simple.

#### Fetching a channel from an interaction

Sometimes, you need the channel in which an interaction was sent, and either you don't have it cached, or you are
running this in a stateless way. To aid with that, we have a utility shortcut function called
[`fetchChannelFromInteraction`][fetchchannelfrominteraction]. As the name suggests, it fetches the channel from the
interaction, and returns it for your usage / consumption.

## Events

Due to Discord's push to adopt Application Commands, combined with the move of making message contents gated behind a
privileged intent (which some love and some hate 🤷), the listeners required for parsing and running message commands
are now optionally loaded by setting [`loadMessageCommandListeners`][loadmessagecommandlisteners] to `true` in your
client options. See an example on the example repository or down below:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{8}|{8}
import { LogLevel, SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';

const client = new SapphireClient({
  intents: ['GUILDS', 'GUILD_MESSAGES'],
  logger: {
    level: LogLevel.Debug
  },
  loadMessageCommandListeners: true
});

await client.login();
```

By default, this is set to `false`, so if you want Sapphire to handle message commands, you'll have to manually enable
it.

:::note

For those interested in the internals, the location of the `errorListeners` and the `message-command-listeners` have
been moved to an internal folder called `optionalListeners`. You don't have to worry about this unless you contribute to
the project and are moving things around

:::

### Event renames

A lot of events have been renamed in order to make them clear about what they represent. If you are using our
[`Events`][events] object and TypeScript, you will get errors in your code. If all you want is a quick find-and-replace
for the event names, here is a table of what has changed to what:

#### Events object changes

| Event object name    | New event object name       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `UnknownCommand`     | `UnknownMessageCommand`     |
| `UnknownCommandName` | `UnknownMessageCommandName` |
| `CommandAccepted`    | `MessageCommandAccepted`    |
| `CommandDenied`      | `MessageCommandDenied`      |
| `CommandError`       | `MessageCommandError`       |
| `CommandFinish`      | `MessageCommandFinish`      |
| `CommandRun`         | `MessageCommandRun`         |
| `CommandSuccess`     | `MessageCommandSuccess`     |
| `CommandTypingError` | `MessageCommandTypingError` |
| `PreCommandRun`      | `PreMessageCommandRun`      |

#### Event string names

| Event string name    | New event string name       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `unknownCommand`     | `unknownMessageCommandName` |
| `unknownCommandName` | `unknownMessageCommandName` |
| `commandAccepted`    | `messageCommandAccepted`    |
| `commandDenied`      | `messageCommandDenied`      |
| `commandError`       | `messageCommandError`       |
| `commandFinish`      | `messageCommandFinish`      |
| `commandRun`         | `messageCommandRun`         |
| `commandSuccess`     | `messageCommandSuccess`     |
| `commandTypingError` | `messageCommandTypingError` |
| `preCommandRun`      | `preMessageCommandRun`      |

### New Events

:::note

Values in `[]` mean they are one of the options you can add at the end of the previous content.

For instance, for `GuildSticker[Create/Delete/Update]`, you have the `GuildStickerCreate`, `GuildStickerDelete` and
`GuildStickerUpdate` events.

:::

#### Discord.js events added:

- GuildSticker[Create/Delete/Update] (`guildSticker[Create/Delete/Update]`)
- InteractionCreate (`interactionCreate`) - This event is handled by Sapphire for application commands and interaction
  handlers.
- InvalidRequestWarning (`invalidRequestWarning`)
- MessageReactionRemove[All/Emoji] (`messageReactionRemove[All/Emoji]`)
- StageInstance[Create/Delete/Update] (`stageInstance[Create/Delete/Update]`)
- Thread[Create/Delete] (`thread[Create/Delete]`)
- ThreadListSync (`threadListSync`)
- ThreadMembersUpdate & ThreadMemberUpdate (`threadMembersUpdate` & `threadMemberUpdate`)
- VoiceServerUpdate (`voiceServerUpdate`)

#### Sapphire events added:

- CommandDoesNotHaveMessageCommandHandler (`commandDoesNotHaveMessageCommandHandler`) - emitted when a command exists
  but is not set up to handle message commands.
- CommandApplicationCommandRegistryError (`commandApplicationCommandRegistryError`) - emitted when a command cannot
  register its commands in the [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][acr].
- InteractionHandlerParseError (`interactionHandlerParseError`) - emitted when an interaction handler's `parse` method
  throws an error.
- InteractionHandlerError (`interactionHandlerError`) - emitted when an interaction handler's `run` method throws an
  error.
- PossibleAutocompleteInteraction (`possibleAutocompleteInteraction`) - emitted when an autocomplete interaction is
  received. This event is handled by Sapphire to redirect it to the proper place. Read more [on the page about
  AutoComplete interactions][autocomplete].
- AutocompleteInteractionSuccess (`autocompleteInteractionSuccess`) - emitted when an autocomplete interaction
  successfully runs.
- AutocompleteInteractionError (`autocompleteInteractionError`) - emitted when an autocomplete interaction throws an
  error during handling.

For chat input and context menu commands, the following events are available. Substitute `[P]` with `ChatInput` or
`ContextMenu`, and `[p]` with `chatInput` or `contextMenu` (lowercase `p` represents the string for the event, while
uppercase `P` represents the [`Events`][events] object name)

- Possible`[P]`Command (`possible[P]Command`) - emitted when a chat input or context menu interaction is received. This
  event is handled by Sapphire to redirect its data to the proper place.
- Unknown`[P]`Command (`unknown[P]Command`) - emitted when we receive an interaction that points to a command we don't
  know about (either it doesn't exist, or we don't have it registered via the registry).
- CommandDoesNotHave`[P]`CommandHandler (`commandDoesNotHave[P]CommandHandler`) - emitted when a command exists but is
  not set up to handle the type of command received.
- Pre`[P]`CommandRun (`pre[P]CommandRun`) - emitted when a command should have its preconditions ran before fully
  running.
- `[P]`CommandDenied (`[p]CommandDenied`) - emitted when a precondition errors and the command is denied from running.
- `[P]`CommandAccepted (`[p]CommandAccepted`) - emitted when all preconditions have succeeded and the command is ready
  to run.
- `[P]`CommandRun (`[p]CommandRun`) - emitted when a command starts to run.
- `[P]`CommandSuccess (`[p]CommandSuccess`) - emitted when the command runs successfully.
- `[P]`CommandError (`[p]CommandError`) - emitted when the command run method throws an error.
- `[P]`CommandFinish (`[p]CommandFinish`) - emitted when the command run is finished.
