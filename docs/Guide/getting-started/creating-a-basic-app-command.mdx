title: Creating a basic slash command
---

Creating a basic slash command is very similar to creating a basic command. The only difference is that you'll need to
handle the command run under `chatInputRun` instead of `messageRun`.

For example, let's create a `ping` command:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4-13}|{4-13}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      name: 'ping',
      description: 'Ping bot to see if it is alive',
      chatInputCommand: {
        register: true
      }
    });
  }
}
```

The above example will create a slash command (chat input command) called `ping` with the description
`Ping bot to see if it is alive`.

## Creating the `chatInputRun` method

To handle the command callback when the context menu command is ran we need to override the `chatInputRun` method of
command class.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{8-17}|{9-17}
import { isMessageInstance } from '@sapphire/discord.js-utilities';
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    // ...
  }

  public async chatInputRun(interaction: Command.ChatInputInteraction) {
    const msg = await interaction.reply({ content: `Ping?`, ephemeral: true, fetchReply: true });

    if (isMessageInstance(msg)) {
      const diff = msg.createdTimestamp - interaction.createdTimestamp;
      const ping = Math.round(this.container.client.ws.ping);
      return interaction.editReply(`Pong 🏓! (Round trip took: ${diff}ms. Heartbeat: ${ping}ms.)`);
    }

    return interaction.editReply('Failed to retrieve ping :(');
  }
}
```

## Creating a slash command with subcommands

:::caution

Currently, progress is still being made on updating the official [Sapphire Plugin Subcommands][saph-plug-subcom]. This
section will fully work now, and will continue to work after the plugin is updated. However, once the plugin has been
updated creating subcommands will be possible with less code.

:::

To create the slash command with subcommand we need to override the `registerApplicationCommands` method of `Command`
class. This method is called when the `Client` collects all the slash commands defined in the command directory on
application startup to register them on the discord API. Let's see a quick example of how to make a slash command with
subcommands.

`Example`

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{12-28}|{12-28}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class SubCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    // ...
  }

  public async chatInputRun(interaction: Command.ChatInputInteraction) {
    // ...
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerChatInputCommand((builder) =>
      builder
        .setName('command')
        .setDescription('Command with sub commands')
        .addSubcommand((command) => command.setName('first').setDescription('First sub command'))
        .addSubcommand((command) => command.setName('second').setDescription('Second sub command'))
    );
  }
}
```

The above will create a slash command called `command` with the description `Command with sub commands`. The command
will have two sub commands, `first` and `second` with description `First sub command` and `Second sub command`
respectively.

To handle the command callback for the sub command we will have to perform checks in the `chatInputRun` method. Let's
see a quick example of how to handle the sub command callback.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{8-18}|{8-18}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class SubCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    // ...
  }

  public async chatInputRun(interaction: Command.ChatInputInteraction) {
    const subcommand = interaction.options.getSubcommand(true);

    if (subcommand === 'first') {
      return await this.first(interaction);
    } else if (subcommand === 'second') {
      return await this.second(interaction);
    }

    return interaction.reply('Invalid sub command');
  }

  private async first(interaction: Command.ChatInputInteraction) {
    // private class method to handle the first sub command
    return interaction.reply('First sub command executed');
  }

  private async second(interaction: Command.ChatInputInteraction) {
    // private class method to handle the second sub command
    return interaction.reply('Second sub command executed');
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
