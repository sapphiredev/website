title: Creating a basic command
---

In order to start registering commands you need to create a subdirectory called `commands` (lowercase!) in your entry
point directory. If you were following [Getting Started][getting-started], it'll be `src/commands`.

Normally, you'd export one command per file to keep things organized. However, as we support various ways of exporting
commands from the file (`export class ...`, `export default class`, `module.exports = class ...` and
`exports.MyCommand = class ...`) you can export multiple commands from the same file.

Note that this doesn't create subcommands. We'll cover those in
[Plugin Subcommands](../plugins/Subcommands/getting-started)

:::info

Note that by default Sapphire does not load the listeners required for processing message commands. You will need to
construct your `SapphireClient` with the `loadMessageCommandListeners` option set to `true`. For more information see
the [`SapphireClientOptions#loadMessageCommandListeners`][load-message-commands-option] interface.

:::

Create a `ping.js` file in your `commands` folder, which will send a message and then edit it with the elapsed time.
Arguments and other features are covered in other pages.

## Creating a command class

Let's start by creating the file for the command class. In your `commands` folder, create a file named `ping.js` (or
`ping.mjs` / `ping.ts` if you're using ESM or TypeScript respectively). This command will send a message, and then edit
it with the bot's WebSocket latency.

Your project directory should now look something like this:

```bash {4-5}
├── node_modules
├── package.json
└── src
    ├── commands
    │   └── ping.js
    └── index.js
```

With the file created, we can start writing our commands by extending the [`Command`][command] class, from which all
commands must be derived.

That said, here is an example of a `ping` command:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4-11}|{4-11}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      name: 'ping',
      aliases: ['pong'],
      description: 'ping pong'
    });
  }
}
```

Let's go over what is defined in the constructor in this code:

- `context`: an object that contains file metadata required by the `Piece` class (which `Command` extends) in order to
  function.
- `name`: by default, the name of the file without the extension, i.e. `ping.js` becomes `ping`, so there's no need to
  define it.
- `aliases`: other ways users can call the command. You can have as many as you want!
- `description`: some text that you can use to display when a "help" command is used.

There are many other properties available, all of which can be seen in the [`CommandOptions`][commandoptions] interface,
but will also be explained in upcoming sections.

## Creating the `messageRun` method

:::danger

If you want to use message commands in your Sapphire bot, you have to make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

1.  Enable the `Message Content Intent` under `Privileged Gateway Intents` on the [Discord Developer Portal][dev-portal]
    for your application.
2.  In your Sapphire client options, set the [`intents`] property to include the intents
    [`GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages`][guild_messages_intent], [`GatewayIntentBits.Guilds`][guilds_intent], and
    [`GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent`][message_content_intent].
3.  In your Sapphire client options set [`loadMessageCommandListeners`][loadMessageCommandListeners] to `true`.

All in all your code should look something like this:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4-12}|{4-12}
import { SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';

const client = new SapphireClient({
  intents: [GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent, GatewayIntentBits.Guilds, GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages],
  loadMessageCommandListeners: true
});
```

:::

Commands have a `messageRun` method, which executes the command logic when it is invoked from a message. Define this
below the command's constructor:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{8-16}|{9-17}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    // ...
  }

  public async messageRun(message: Message) {
    const msg = await message.channel.send('Ping?');

    const content = `Pong from JavaScript! Bot Latency ${Math.round(this.container.client.ws.ping)}ms. API Latency ${
      msg.createdTimestamp - message.createdTimestamp
    }ms.`;

    return msg.edit(content);
  }
}
```

Any discord.js code can be executed here since the Sapphire Framework is an extension of it. The command can be
triggered with `@bot ping` or `@bot pong` (custom prefixes are mentioned in other documents).

## Resulting code

Once you've set up the `constructor` and the `messageRun` method, your code should look like this:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      name: 'ping',
      aliases: ['pong'],
      description: 'ping pong'
    });
  }

  public async messageRun(message: Message) {
    const msg = await message.channel.send('Ping?');

    const content = `Pong from JavaScript! Bot Latency ${Math.round(this.container.client.ws.ping)}ms. API Latency ${
      msg.createdTimestamp - message.createdTimestamp
    }ms.`;

    return msg.edit(content);
  }
}
```
