title: Global preconditions
---

Sometimes you want a precondition that automatically runs for every command, without having to add it to each command.
This is where global preconditions come in.

Creating a global precondition is very similar to creating a normal precondition. The only difference is that you need
to add the [`position`] option to the options of the particular precondition. The position determines the priority at
which a global precondition is ran. A lower position means it runs before those with a higher position, and vice versa.

:::info

By default Sapphire ships with 1 single global precondition, the `Enabled` precondition, which checks if a piece is
enabled through the optional `enabled?: boolean` option. This global precondition has a position of `10` to allow users
to have global preconditions with a higher priority, however, we do not recommend you do this as piece enabled checks
are recommended to be the first thing to check.

:::

Following is an example of a simple global precondition that checks if the command is used in a server that was added to
an arbitrary banlist stored in a database. In this code snippet we set the [`position`] to value `20`, which means it
will run _after_ the `Enabled` precondition.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{7}|{7}
import { AllFlowsPrecondition, Piece, Result } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { ChatInputCommandInteraction, ContextMenuCommandInteraction, Message } from 'discord.js';

export class UserPrecondition extends AllFlowsPrecondition {
  #message =
    "Sorry but your server is banned from using this bot's commands. Contact the bot developer for more information.";

  public constructor(context: Piece.Context, options: AllFlowsPrecondition.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      position: 20
    });
  }

  public override chatInputRun(interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction) {
    return this.doBanlistCheck(interaction.guildId);
  }

  public override contextMenuRun(interaction: ContextMenuCommandInteraction) {
    return this.doBanlistCheck(interaction.guildId);
  }

  public override messageRun(message: Message) {
    return this.doBanlistCheck(message.guildId);
  }

  private async doBanlistCheck(guildId: string | null) {
    if (guildId === null) return this.ok();

    const isInBannedGuild = await Result.fromAsync(
      this.container.prisma.bannedGuilds.findFirstOrThrow({ where: { snowflake: BigInt(guildId) } })
    );

    // SQL query failed, therefore no guild was found, therefore the guild is not banned.
    if (isInBannedGuild.isErr()) return this.ok();

    // Guild was found, therefore it is banned.
    return this.error({ identifier: 'GuildNotInBanList', message: this.#message });
  }
}
```

:::info A few notes about this code snippet

- We use the [`AllFlowsPrecondition`] class, which is a special class that allows you to use the same precondition for
  all flows. This is useful for global preconditions, as you want to use the same precondition for all flows.
- If the command is executed in a DM, we return `this.ok()` to allow the command to run.
- In this example we use [Prisma][prisma], but you can use any database library you want.
- We use the [`Result`] class to make checking if the guild was in the banlist or not easier. This is not required, but
  it is recommended.
