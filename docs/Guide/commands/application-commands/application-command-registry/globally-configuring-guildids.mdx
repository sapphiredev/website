title: Globally configuring guildIds
---

Previously at [Registering Chat Input Commands - guildIds][register-guildIds] we covered how to register single commands
in one or multiple guilds. You may however want to register all your commands in the same guild and not have to repeat
the same guildIds over and over again. There are two ways to do this.

First of all your can leverage JavaScript modules. This means simply exporting a constant in another file that holds the
guildIds and using that every command. This used to be the recommended way to achieve this, however because many people
have asked about registering guildIds globally we have implemented this directly into the framework as well, and that
brings us to the second way.

In order to globally configure the guildIds can use
[ApplicationCommandRegistries.setDefaultGuildIds][setDefaultGuildIds]. This method takes an array of guildIds and will
use those for every command that is registered. The ids defined here will _only_ take effect if the command does _not_
have any `guildIds` defined. This means that you can override the global configuration on a per-command basis by
including `guildIds` in the configuration, and you _must_ remove the `guildIds` from the command configuration if you
want to use the global configuration.

To configure the global guildIds you can do the following:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{3}|{3}
import { ApplicationCommandRegistries } from '@sapphire/framework';

ApplicationCommandRegistries.setDefaultGuildIds(['737141877803057244']);
```

[setDefaultGuildIds]: ../../../../Documentation/api-framework/#applicationcommandregistries
[register-guildIds]: ./registering-chat-input-commands#guildids
