title: Accessing the Client
---

Often when writing your [listeners], [commands], [preconditions], [arguments] and other pieces you will want to access
your instance of [SapphireClient]. This can be done by accessing the `client` property on the [`container`] interface.
The [`container`] is a way that Sapphire achieved [dependency injection][di]. There are several ways to access the
[`container`]:

## Using `this.container` inside pieces

When writing code within the closure of a class that extends [`Piece`] such as a [`Command`], [`Listener`],
[`Precondition`], or [`Argument`] you can access the container through `this.container`. This is by far the easiest way
to then access the client, as you can simply write `this.container.client`. A quick and dirty example of this is:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{5}|{5}
import { Listener } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class UserEvent extends Listener {
  public override run() {
    this.container.logger.info('A user event was received');
  }
}
```

## Importing `container` from Sapphire

When writing code outside of the closure of a class that extends [`Piece`] you can import the [`container`] from either
`@sapphire/framework` or `@sapphire/pieces`. A quick and dirty example of this is:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{1,4}|{1,4}
import { container } from '@sapphire/framework';

export function myVeryCoolFunction() {
  container.logger.info('myVeryCoolFunction was called');
}
```

:::info

`@sapphire/framework` re-exports the [`container`] from `@sapphire/pieces` so from which you import does not matter,
they are identical.
