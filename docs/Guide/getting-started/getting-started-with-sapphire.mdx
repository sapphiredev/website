title: Getting started with Sapphire
---

To install Sapphire, you need to install both `discord.js` and `@sapphire/framework`. You can do this by running the
following command:

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install @sapphire/framework discord.js
```

:::caution

You need at least Node.js version 16.6.0 to use Sapphire.

When using Sapphire, it is important that you set a `main` property in your package.json. This is used to determine 
where we will need to look for your commands, listeners, and other pieces. If you don't set this property, we will 
not be able to automatically find your bot's pieces.

You should set this property to the main file of your project; where you call `client.login()`. For example, if your 
`client.login()` is located at `src/index.js`, then you should set your `main` to `src/index.js`.

Here is an example of a package.json file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-new-bot",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "@sapphire/framework": "latest",
    "discord.js": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  }
}
```

## Creating an `index.js` file

While it doesn't have to be called `index.js`, this file will be the main file for your bot (otherwise known as the
entry point) as it'll handle the bot's setup and login. It's recommended to put this inside a subdirectory of your
project, typically `src`, both for organization and for [Creating Commands](creating-a-basic-command).

To begin, import `@sapphire/framework` and instantiate [`SapphireClient`][sapphire]. This is where you can customize
Sapphire's and discord.js' behaviour. Sapphire's client extends discord.js', so everything from [`Client`][djs-client]
is available in [`SapphireClient`][sapphire]!

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{3}|{3}
import { SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';

const client = new SapphireClient({ intents: ['GUILDS', 'GUILD_MESSAGES'] });

client.login('your-token-goes-here');
```

Sapphire detects mention prefixes (`@bot command`), but you can optionally define any number of default prefixes with
the `defaultPrefix` option and `regexPrefix` for more complex cases.

There is also the advanced option [`baseUserDirectory`][baseuserdirectory], which allows you to define the base
directory Sapphire will scan. By default, Sapphire registers this as the directory containing your entry point and
locates stores within it. As such, if the root directory is `src`, it will register `src/commands` as one of the command
directories.

You should use environment variables or a `config.json` for your token instead of passing it directly! You can read more
about why you should [here][securing-your-token].

:::

And that's it for your `index.js` file! In the end, your directory should look like this, along with whatever
`.gitignore` or `config.json` files you may have:

```bash {4}
├── node_modules
├── package.json
└── src
    └── index.js
```
