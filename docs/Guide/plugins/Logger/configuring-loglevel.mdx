title: Configuring default logger level

## Introduction

A log level is a number that represents the importance of a log message. The higher the number, the more important the
log message is. The default log level is `Info`, which means that all log messages except `Trace` and `Debug` are logged.

Since the default level is `Info` it will skip all the `Debug` messages which are important for debugging purposes and
also during devlopment.

## Usage

Default log level can be customized in the `logger` options of the [`SapphireClient`][sapphire].

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{3}|{3}
import { LogLevel, SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';

const client = new SapphireClient({ logger: { level: LogLevel.Debug } });
```

The above will set the default log level to `Debug` which will lead to logging the debug messages in console. This is something
which we don't want when application is running in production. To exempt that from `logger` during production we can
configure the `logger level` dynamicaally.

`Example`
```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{3}|{3}
import { LogLevel, SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';

const client = new SapphireClient({
	logger: {
		level: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? LogLevel.Debug : LogLevel.Info
	}
});
```

Above example will set the `logger level` to `Debug` during development and to `Info` during production.

:::caution

Setting `logger level` to a specific level makes logger ignore the lower logger levels. This means that if level is set to
`warn` then logger will not log `info` messages.
