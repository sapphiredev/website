title: Creating a basic slash command
---

:::warning

This section covers the **absolute minimum** for setting up a slash command. We have an entire "Application Commands"
section on how to effectively set up slash commands, and if you are doing anything serious we highly recommend you start
there with [`What are application commands?`][what-are-application-commands]

:::

To create a slash command (known as a Chat Input Command in Sapphire), you will need to implement the
`registerApplicationCommands` method in the `Command` class. Let's create a `ping` command and register a corresponding
slash command with Discord:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{3-13}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.LoaderContext, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, { ...options });
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerChatInputCommand((builder) =>
      builder.setName('ping').setDescription('Ping bot to see if it is alive')
    );
  }
}
```

The example above will register a slash command with Discord called `ping` with the description
`'Ping bot to see if it is alive'`. This is the information users will see in Discord when interacting with your bot
through the slash command.

In order for your bot to respond to the slash command when it is invoked by a user, you must implement the
`chatInputRun` method for the `Command` class.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{15-25}
import { isMessageInstance } from '@sapphire/discord.js-utilities';
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { MessageFlags } from 'discord.js';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.LoaderContext, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, { ...options });
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerChatInputCommand((builder) =>
      builder.setName('ping').setDescription('Ping bot to see if it is alive')
    );
  }

  public override async chatInputRun(interaction: Command.ChatInputCommandInteraction) {
    const callbackResponse = await interaction.reply({
      content: `Ping?`,
      withResponse: true,
      flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral
    });
    const msg = callbackResponse.resource?.message;

    if (msg && isMessageInstance(msg)) {
      const diff = msg.createdTimestamp - interaction.createdTimestamp;
      const ping = Math.round(this.container.client.ws.ping);
      return interaction.editReply(`Pong üèì! (Round trip took: ${diff}ms. Heartbeat: ${ping}ms.)`);
    }

    return interaction.editReply('Failed to retrieve ping :(');
  }
}
```

## Creating a slash command with subcommands

:::note

For handling subcommands, please refer to the [Sapphire Plugin Subcommands][saph-plug-subcom] documentation.
